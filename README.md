# LoginOS
Twiddling around, trying to make a simple OS build, I have little idea what I am doing.

## Goal
The end goal of this project, is to make a simple, and fun Operating system, that is themed around the student Organization: Login.
This is subject to change in the future, as I am not always a student.

## Details
This is as of now a one man poject, where I am taking HEAVY inspiration from guides and the like, as I am not really qualified to make an operating system all by myself.
